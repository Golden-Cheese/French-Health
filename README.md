## About this project
This is a project on data visualisation for a course on Data visualisation techniques from Master's degree IPAC (Interaction, perception, Learning and Knowledge), research approach, given at Université de Lorraine in Nancy, France.

Its aim was to retrieve interesting informations from open data datasets and propose interesting data visualisations.

The chosen dataset is available as open source data in the French governments' data page :
  - Données de consommations et habitudes alimentaires de l'étude INCA 2 (url : https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/donnees-de-consommations-et-habitudes-alimentaires-de-letude-inca-2-3//)
